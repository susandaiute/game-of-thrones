House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm, Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

Joffrey totally does not die.

And now we move the story one commit forward, where zombie Ned rises from
the dead to exact revenge upon Joffrey.
My dream is that Ned and his family had a great time in King's Landing and then returned to Winterfell.

When they got to Winterfell, they threw a giant kegger.  The white walkers were def not invited, but they showed up anyway.
